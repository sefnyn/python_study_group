    <h1>Early Years</h1>
    <p>
        From a young age, Jane Austen was a thrill seeker, a daredevil, and an adrenaline junkie. Growing up in the late 19th century, she was inspired by her father’s stories of racing – the risk, the speed, the danger – and she felt a calling to the track. Though she initially encountered opposition, she persisted, and eventually earned her place on the circuit, becoming one of the first female racers in the world.

        Jane Austen began her career with the Royal Automobile Club, and quickly rose to the top of the standings. Her skill and tenacity earned her numerous accolades, and soon she was competing with – and beating – some of the best racers in the world. She raced for many years, earning victory after victory, before finally retiring in 1945.
